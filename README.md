# Gesture-Control-System
1. First stage of our project was to identify the correct algorithm to emliminate the noise and read the gesture.
2. Several algorithm were studied and tried on python ide for best fit.
3. Second Stage involved reading the gestures and associate them with set of functions.
4. Compartmentalizing the gestures were done by reading the no. of finger tips involved(Edges identified)
5. Third Stage was assinging certain tasks for these functions.
